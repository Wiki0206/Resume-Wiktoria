        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I am a young and ambitious woman who wants to develop in the dynamic IT industry. I am 22 years old, living and born in Wrocław, where I am also studying. I graduated in Management at the Higher Academy of Business and started another course, namely UX Researcher and Designer, which gives me a solid foundation in this field of computer science. Additionally, I have taken up another field: Strategic Human Resources Management. As a young professional, I continuously develop my skills by participating in online courses and training. I strive to obtain industry certifications.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Learning is my passion. Acquiring knowledge and personal development are the two main areas that are closest to me. I am fluent in English (B2/C1). I am a fan of popular science and scientific literature in the fields of computer science, medicine, psychology, business, and personal development. I am proficient in using Excel, Google Cloud, DropBox, and similar tools. I love programming and have successful projects under my belt. Databases are also familiar to me, and I am proficient in SQL. I am currently taking refresher courses in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL languages. I am constantly evolving in this direction. It is my passion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Additionally, I have a very optimistic approach to life and love challenges where creativity helps me overcome them. I establish interpersonal relationships quickly and easily, which is why I enjoy teamwork. I am a confident and motivated individual. I approach my assigned tasks with great attention to detail and can manage my work time perfectly, utilizing it to the fullest. When I can't solve a task, I search for information in all possible and helpful sources.</p>
